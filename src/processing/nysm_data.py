def load_nysm_data():
    """
    Load and concatenate NYSM (New York State Mesonet) data from parquet files.

    NYSM data is resampled at 1-hour intervals and stored in separate parquet files
    for each year from 2018 to 2022.

    Returns:
        nysm_1H_obs (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing concatenated NYSM data with
        missing values filled for the 'snow_depth' column.

    This function reads NYSM data from parquet files, resamples it to a 1-hour interval,
    and concatenates the data from multiple years. Missing values in the 'snow_depth'
    column are filled with -999, and any rows with missing values are dropped before
    returning the resulting DataFrame.

    Example:
    ```
    nysm_data = load_nysm_data()
    print(nysm_data.head())
    ```

    Note: Ensure that the parquet files are located in the specified path before using this function.
